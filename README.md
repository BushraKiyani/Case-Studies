# Case Studies Portfolio - Quantitative Analysis & Forecasting

This repository contains a collection of analytical case studies covering descriptive statistics, distribution comparison, regression modeling, and financial forecasting. The projects demonstrate applied statistical reasoning, reproducible workflows, and model comparison across classical and machine-learning approaches.

The case studies progress from foundational statistical analysis to predictive modeling and financial time-series forecasting.
