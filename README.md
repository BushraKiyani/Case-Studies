# Case Studies Portfolio

This repository contains six analytical case-study projects completed as part of introductory and advanced quantitative analysis coursework. The projects progress from descriptive statistics to distribution comparisons, regression modeling, and equity premium forecasting with both classical and machine-learning approaches.

## Repository Overview

| Project | Focus Area | Main Assets |
|---|---|---|
| `ICS-Project1-Descriptive Analysis Of Demographic Data` | Exploratory/descriptive demographic analysis | `ICSProject1.R`, `ICSProject1.Rmd`, `Report.pdf` |
| `ICS-Project2-Comparison Of Multiple Distributions` | Statistical comparison of multiple distributions (swimming time dataset) | `Project2.R`, `Project2.Rmd`, `SwimmingTimes.csv`, report/code PDFs |
| `ICS-Project3-Regression Analysis` | Regression analysis workflow | `ICSProject3.ipynb`, report/code PDFs |
| `Project4-Forecasting-the-Equity-Premium` | Baseline equity premium forecasting and predictor examination | `Bushra_Kiyani_CS_P1_Code.R`, predictor dataset, report |
| `Project5-Forecastin-The-Equity-Premium-Using-ML` | Machine-learning models for equity premium forecasting | `Bushra_Kiyani_CS_P2_Code.R`, report |
| `Project6-Forecasting-The-Equity-Premium-Comparisons` | Comparative study across equity premium forecasting approaches | `Bushra_Kiyani_CS_P3_Code.R`, report |

## Project-by-Project Notes

### 1) ICS Project 1 — Descriptive Analysis of Demographic Data
- Performs descriptive analysis and summary statistics for demographic variables.
- Includes both script-based (`.R`) and literate-analysis (`.Rmd`) versions.
- Accompanied by project statement and final report PDFs.

### 2) ICS Project 2 — Comparison of Multiple Distributions
- Studies and compares multiple statistical distributions.
- Uses `SwimmingTimes.csv` as a core dataset for empirical analysis.
- Includes reproducible analysis in R/R Markdown plus report artifacts.

### 3) ICS Project 3 — Regression Analysis
- Focuses on regression modeling and interpretation.
- Main analytical notebook is provided as `ICSProject3.ipynb`.
- Includes report and code-export PDFs.

### 4) Project 4 — Forecasting the Equity Premium
- Builds foundational forecasting models for the equity premium.
- Includes predictor data and variable descriptions for feature context.
- Contains project code and report documenting methodology and findings.

### 5) Project 5 — Forecasting the Equity Premium Using ML
- Extends equity premium forecasting with machine-learning methods.
- Includes implementation code in R and a project report.

### 6) Project 6 — Forecasting the Equity Premium Comparisons
- Compares forecasting model families and/or prior project approaches.
- Consolidates comparative results in final report form with supporting R code.

## Typical Tooling
- **R / RStudio** for `.R` and `.Rmd` based projects.
- **Jupyter Notebook (Python environment)** for the regression notebook project.
- **PDF reports** for final writeups and interpretations.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Open a project folder of interest.
2. Review the corresponding report PDF for context, assumptions, and conclusions.
3. Re-run code from `.R`, `.Rmd`, or `.ipynb` files to reproduce or extend the analysis.
4. Check associated data files (where provided) before execution.
## Notes
- Several projects include both source code and exported code/report PDFs.
- Folder names and file names are preserved as originally submitted.
